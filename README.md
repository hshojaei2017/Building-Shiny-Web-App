The main goal of this presentation is to introduce a Shiny web app we have developed for the Developing Data Products course from Coursera.

The app loads mtcars dataset and allows the user to:

1. Plot different parameters relative to each other

2. Set marker shape and color based on different parameters

3. Fit a linear regression model to the data and display the equation
